<Gamers At Yellow_tables, brownsugarpup > :  <@&688849073318789193> d&d this sunday, a lot of you decided to kill off or remaster your characters, as such a lot of this session will be helping you all acctualy make our characters, but what i mean by that is not "you show up with an idea and i help you"

what i mean is, "you show up with a finished character, and then we can help fit that character into the world (helping the characters motives make senece within the world, working their backstory into the world, etc...) please do not show up with just an idea for your character"
